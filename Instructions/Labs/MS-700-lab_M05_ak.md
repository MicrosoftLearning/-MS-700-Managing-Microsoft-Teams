### **Exercise 1: Manage Live event and meetings experiences**

Contoso organization has deployed Microsoft 365 and is testing pilot projects on collaboration and communication scenarios to meet business requirements. First, Teams admins need to configure meeting policies and schedule initial meetings. Then, business managers want to test the Live meetings option in Microsoft Teams in order to broadcast audio and video to large audiences.

#### Task 1 - Edit the default meeting policy and restrict all recording features for meetings

As part of your pilot project for setting up the events and meetings in your organization, you need to fulfil the requirement for all meetings in teams, including prohibiting meeting recording. You will edit the default meeting policy to ensure that this requirement is met.
