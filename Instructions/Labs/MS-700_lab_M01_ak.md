# Lab 01: Manage roles and create teams
# Student lab answer key
## Microsoft 365 user interface 

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content. This will manifest itself in UI changes that do not match up with the detailed instructions presented in this lab manual. 

The Microsoft World-Wide Learning team will update this training course as soon as any such changes are brought to our attention. However, given the dynamic nature of cloud updates, you may run into UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, you will have to adapt to the changes and work through them in the lab exercises as needed.**

## Lab Scenario  

In the labs of this course you will assume the role of Joni Sherman, a System Administrator for Contoso Ltd. and her pilot team that shall evaluate the capabilities of Microsoft Teams in a testing environment. You have implemented Microsoft 365 in a virtualized lab environment already and were commissioned to conduct a pilot project to test the implementation of Microsoft Teams against Contoso Ltd. business requirements. 

You have just started the pilot project, and you’ve already got two virtual machines with preinstalled Teams Desktop clients and a tenant with different users:

- Joni Sherman (JoniS@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com) **Group coordinator /** **Teams admin**
- Alex Wilber (AlexW@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com) **Regular pilot user from Canada**
- Lynne Robbins (LynneR@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com) **Regular pilot user**
- Allan Deyoung (AllanD@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com) **Teams communication support engineer**
- Megan Bowen (MeganB@YourTenant.OnMicrosoft.com) **Regular employee**

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Assign Teams admin roles to users
- Check license assignment for users
- Understand the Teams admin center and it’s menus
- Install the Teams PowerShell module and explore its cmdlets
- Install the Skype for Business Online PowerShell module and explore its cmdlets
- Create Office 365 groups from the M365 admin center
- Create new teams using the Teams Desktop client
- Create new teams using the Teams web client
 
## Lab Setup  
- **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes.

## Instructions
### Before you start

The lab in this course have been prepared for a Microsoft Teams deployment at Contoso Ltd. Corporation. Contoso is running a Microsoft 365 cloud only deployment. The lab environments have been specifically designed in this manner to give you experience managing Microsoft Teams in a Microsoft 365 deployment. You will be provided with two virtual machines and a Microsoft 365 tenant to complete the lab steps. 

#### **1. Sign in to the lab virtual machines**

The labs in this course will use two virtual machines:

- Client 1 VM : a stand-alone Windows 10 client virtual machine with Microsoft Teams pre-installed.

- Client 2 VM : a stand-alone Windows 10 client virtual machine with Microsoft Teams pre-installed.

**Note:** Lab virtual machine sign in instructions will be provided to you by your instructor.

**Important:** A local administrator account has been created on the client VMs. These will be the accounts that you use to sign in to each VM. All MS700 lab exercises will use the admin account for sign-in. 

Since the MS700 lab scenario involves a cloud-only deployment, you will not be signing in into an on-premises domain, since no such domain exists. Following your sign-in, the desktop will indicate that you are signed in as either the local user **CLIENT01\\Admin** or **CLIENT02\\admin**, depending on which machine you are on.


#### **2. Review installed applications**

Once you signed in to the VM, observe the start menu, and verify following applications have been installed:
- Microsoft Teams

#### **3. Review Microsoft 365 tenant**

Beside two VMs, you will also be provided with a Microsoft 365 tenant with following highlights:

- Office 365 E5 with Enterprise Mobility + Security E5.
- 15 licenses in total with 5 available of 15(10 used). 
- One Global Administrator (MOD Administrator) and 9 standard users have been pre-created. 


**Note:** Microsoft 365 sign in instructions will be provided to you by your instructor. 

- The username of the Global Administrator (MOD Administrator) is **admin@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com**. 

- **@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com -** This is the domain associated with the Office 365 tenant that was provided by the lab hosting provider. The first part of this domain name (YourTenant) is the unique tenant ID provided by the lab hosting provider. The YourTenant portion of the tenant ID, which is the tenant suffix ID, will be unique for each student. 

	**IMPORTANT:** This is critical because throughout this lab, you will be asked to enter the **YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com** domain name when signing into apps with a given username (for example, JoniS@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com). When doing so, you must enter the unique tenant suffix ID that is assigned to your tenant ID in place of the **YourTenant**.

	For example, if your Tenant Email is **admin@contosolab.onmicrosoft.com**, the unique tenant suffix ID (YOURTENANT) is **contosolab**. When signing in as Joni when entering this domain, you would replace YOURTENANT with contosolab (for example, JoniS@contosolab.onmicrosoft.com). 

- **RECOMMENDATION:** You should write down your unique tenant suffix, mentioned as YOURTENANT in this lab and provided by your training provider. After a while, you will have this name or number memorized as you move through the labs in this course. 

- **Use the new Microsoft 365 admin center**
Throughout the lab exercises for this course, if you navigate to the Microsoft 365 admin center, make sure the slider in the upper right corner is set to **The new admin center**. If you can read **Try the new admin center**, select the slider and activate it.   
‎  
‎**IMPORTANT:** The instructions that are provided in the lab exercises for this course are based on the new Microsoft 365 admin center UI and not the classic UI.

### Exercise 1: Prepare team roles and licenses
In the first exercise you will assign required administrative roles to users, check license assignments for the Teams license and then explore the Microsoft Teams admin center. To perform these tasks, you will use default tenant global admin and the Joni Sherman ([JoniS@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:JoniS@m365xzzzzzz.onmicrosoft.com)) account.

#### **Task 1 - Assign a Teams Admin Role to a user**  
In this task you will use the default global admin to sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and assign several Teams admin roles to different users. This task is crucial for later tasks and exercises as you will perform most of the tasks in context of Joni Sherman’s account.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** with the credentials that have been provided to you.

2. Open **Microsoft** **Edge**, maximize the window and navigate to [**https://portal.office.com/**](https://portal.office.com/).

10. When you are finished reviewing all settings from the Teams admin center, close the browser window and leave the client open as it is.

You have successfully explored several available menus from the Teams admin center, for managing teams and configuring policies in your tenant. You have finished the first exercise and you can continue with the next one.

### Exercise 2: Explore PowerShell cmdlets for teams

In this exercise you will install the Teams and Skype for Business Online PowerShell modules, required to manage teams, policy packages, telephony and all other settings for Teams in your tenant. You can perform most of the tasks possible from the Teams admin center also in the PowerShell with the two mentioned modules, you can script for automation and even access several settings not available in the GUI.
 
#### **Task 1 - Install Teams PowerShell module**
Before you can connect to Teams from your tenant and perform any actions, you need to install the Teams PowerShell module. You can install the Teams PowerShell module from the available repositories preconfigured in your Windows 10 operating system and don’t need to download any executables via the browser.

**Note:** The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks when done on servers.
