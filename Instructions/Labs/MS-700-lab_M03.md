## Instructions



### Exercise 1: Calculate networking capabilities 

Microsoft Teams provides users with chat, audio, video and content sharing experience in different network conditions. It includes variable codecs, where media can be negotiated in limited bandwidth environments. However, as a Teams admin, you will need to carefully plan your network bandwidth, because there are other Office 365 services and third-party apps that also need reliable network connection. Therefore, it is very important that Teams admins have tools that could help to estimate the bandwidth consumption according to specific business requirements and existing network infrastructure, and provide best experience to business users.


#### Task 1 - Calculate network bandwidth capacity

In this exercise, you will calculate the network requirements for Microsoft teams, depending on your expected Teams usage business requirements. You must ensure enough bandwidth based on your organization network connectivity that is described in the following table:
 
| **Location**       | **Total number of employees**    | **WAN link capacity / audio/video queue size (Mbps)** | **Office 365 connection**  | **Internet connection** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| New York HQ | 1000| 1000/300/500 | ExpressRoute | Local Internet 1000 Mbps|
| Los Angeles Office | 250 | 500/100/200  | Remote connection through HQ | Remote Internet through HQ | 
| Houston Office     | 150 | 400/50/100   | Remote connection through HQ                          | Remote Internet through HQ |     

Next, you will analyze your current bandwidth usage and test your network quality and connection to Microsoft Teams. You will also need to troubleshoot potential voice quality issues.
