## **Lab Setup**

- **Estimated Time:** 90 minutes.

## **Instructions**

### **Before you start**

The lab in this course have been prepared for a Microsoft Teams deployment at Contoso Ltd. Corporation. Contoso is running a Microsoft 365 cloud only deployment. The lab environments have been specifically designed in this manner to give you experience managing Microsoft Teams in a Microsoft 365 deployment. You will be provided with two virtual machines and a Microsoft 365 tenant to complete the lab steps.

#### **1. Sign in to the lab virtual machines**

The labs in this course will use two virtual machines:

- Client 1 VM : a stand-alone Windows 10 client virtual machine with Microsoft Teams pre-installed.

- Client 2 VM : a stand-alone Windows 10 client virtual machine with Microsoft Teams pre-installed.

**Note:** Lab virtual machine sign in instructions will be provided to you by your instructor.

**Important:** The exercises in the MS-700 labs are cloud-only deployments. A local administrator account has been created on the client VMs. You will log into the VMs as a local administrator instead of a domain account. Following your login, the desktop will indicate that you are logged in as either **CLIENT1\Admin** or **CLIENT2\admin**, depending on which machine you are on.

#### **2. Review installed applications**

Once you signed in to the VM, observe the start menu, and verify following applications have been installed:

- Microsoft Teams

#### **3. Review Microsoft 365 tenant**

Beside two VMs, you will also be provided with a Microsoft 365 tenant with following highlights:

- Office 365 E5 with Enterprise Mobility + Security E5.

- 15 licenses in total with 5 available of 15(10 used).

- One Global Administrator (MOD Administrator) and 9 standard users have been pre-created.

  **Note:** Microsoft 365 sign in instructions will be provided to you by your instructor.

- The username of the Global Administrator (MOD Administrator) is **admin@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com**.

- **&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com** - This is the domain associated with the Microsoft 365 tenant that was provided by the lab hosting provider. The first part of this domain name (&lt;YourTenant&gt;) is the unique tenant ID provided by the lab hosting provider. The &lt;YourTenant&gt; portion of the tenant ID, which is the tenant suffix ID, will be unique for each student.

  **IMPORTANT:** This is critical because throughout this lab, you will be asked to enter the **&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com** domain name when signing into apps with a given username (for example, JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com). When doing so, you must enter the unique tenant suffix ID that is assigned to your tenant ID in place of the **&lt;YourTenant&gt;**.

  For example, if your Tenant Email is **admin@contosolab.onmicrosoft.com**, the unique tenant suffix ID (&lt;YourTenant&gt;) is **contosolab**. When signing in as Joni when entering this domain, you would replace &lt;YourTenant&gt; with contosolab (for example, JoniS@contosolab.onmicrosoft.com).

   **RECOMMENDATION:** You should write down your unique tenant suffix, mentioned as &lt;YourTenant&gt; in this lab and provided by your training provider. After a while, you will have this name or number memorized as you move through the labs in this course.

- **Use the new Microsoft 365 admin center** 

  Throughout the lab exercises for this course, if you navigate to the Microsoft 365 admin center, make sure the slider in the upper right corner is set to **The new admin center**. If you can read **Try the new admin center**, select the slider and activate it.  
‎‎  
‎‎  **IMPORTANT:** The instructions that are provided in the lab exercises for this course are based on the new Microsoft 365 admin center UI and not the classic UI.

### **Exercise 1: Prepare Teams admin roles and licenses**

In the first exercise you will assign required administrative roles to users and check license assignments for the Teams license. To perform these tasks, you will use default tenant global admin.

#### **Task 1 - Assign Teams admin roles to users**

In this task you will use the default global admin to sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and assign several Teams admin roles to different users. This task is crucial for later tasks and exercises as you will perform most of the tasks in context of Joni Sherman’s account.

3. Assign **Teams device admin** role to **Alex Wilber**

    Repeat the same steps and assign **Teams Device Administrator** role to **Alex Wilber**.

4. Assign **Teams communication admin** role to **Allan Deyoung**

    Repeat the same steps and assign **Teams communication admin** role to **Allan Deyoung**.

You have now successfully assigned the Teams admin roles.

* Teams Administrator: Joni Sherman
* Teams Devices Administrator: Alex Wilber
* Teams communication admin: Allan Deyoung 

Proceed to the next task.

#### **Task 2 – Check license assignment of your users**

In this task, you will check the license assignment of all users participating in the pilot. At the end of the task you will confirm that all pilot users are licensed correctly and Alex Wilber’s location is updated to Canada as preparation for a later task.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** and browse to Microsoft 365 admin center (https://admin.microsoft.com/) as **MOD Administrator**.
