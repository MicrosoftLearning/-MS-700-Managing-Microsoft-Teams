#### Task 1 - Create a team from an existing Microsoft 365 Group

As part of your pilot project for Contoso, you need to modify the **"IT-Department"** Microsoft 365 Group, created in an earlier lab, and add Teams features to it.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** with the credentials that have been provided to you.

2. Select the **Teams** icon on the taskbar to start the Teams Desktop client and sign in as **Joni Sherman** (JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.OnMicrosoft.com).

3. The Microsoft Teams Desktop client will start. If a **Bring your team together**, or **Get the Teams mobile app** window appears, close both windows.

4. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **Teams**, select **Join or create a team**, and then select **Create team** from the middle of the window.

5. In the **Create a team** dialog, select **From a group or team**.

8. Select the three dots (**‚Ä¶**) right from the new team in the left pane and select **Manage team**.

9. Check, if **Joni Sherman** is still listed below Owners.

10. Select **Members and guests** and check that following members are still listed: **Lynne Robbins**, **Megan Bowen**, **Allan Deyoung** and **Alex Wilber**.

11. Select the **General** channel below the **IT-Department** teams.

12. Close the Teams Desktop client.

You have successfully created a new team with the Teams Desktop client, by using an existing Microsoft 365 Group. Leave the Teams client open and continue with the next task.

#### Task 2 - Create a team by using PowerShell

In this task, you will create via the Teams PowerShell a new team **"CA-Office"**. You will create the public channels **"Support"** and **"Recruiting"**. Additionally, you will create the private channel **"Administration"** via Teams PowerShell.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** with the credentials that have been provided to you.

2. On the taskbar at the bottom of the page, right select the **Start** button and then select **Windows PowerShell**.

3. Run the following cmdlet to connect to Microsoft Teams in your tenant:

    ```powershell
    Connect-MicrosoftTeams
    ```

4. A **Sign in** dialog box will open. Enter the **UPN** of **Joni Sherman‚Äôs** O365 Credentials provided to you (for example, JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com) and then select **Next**.

5. In the **Enter password** dialog box, enter the **password** of **Joni Sherman‚Äôs** O365 Credentials provided to you and then select **Sign in**.

6. Type the following cmdlet to the PowerShell window to create the new team **CA-Office**:

    ```powershell
    New-Team -Displayname "CA-Office" -MailNickName "CA-Office" -Visibility Public
    ```

7. To add the user **Alex Wilber** to the team type the following cmdlet (Replacing **&lt;YourTenant&gt;** with the name of the Microsoft 365 Tenant provided to you.):

    ```powershell
    Get-Team -Displayname "CA-Office" | Add-TeamUser -User AlexW@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com
    ```

8. To add the user **Allan Deyoung** to the team type the following cmdlet (Replacing **&lt;YourTenant&gt;** with the name of the Microsoft 365 Tenant provided to you.):

    ```powershell
    Get-Team -Displayname "CA-Office" | Add-TeamUser -User AllanD@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com
    ```

9. Create a channel **Support** in the **CA-Office** team by using the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Get-Team -Displayname "CA-Office" | New-TeamChannel -DisplayName "Support"
    ```

10. Create another channel **Recruiting** in the **CA-Office** team by using the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell

15. Close all browser windows and the Teams Desktop Client.

You have successfully created a team named **CA-Office** with the members Alex Wilber and Allan Deyoung. Joni Sherman is the only team owner. Note that you did not specify any owner in the PowerShell cmdlet and because it was run in context of Joni, she was added as owner automatically. Furthermore, you have created the public channels named **Support** and **Recruiting**, as well as the private channel named **Administration**.

#### Task 3 - Create a team by using Graph API

In this task, you will test the Graph API capabilities for certain automation plans of your organization with Teams. For this task, you will create a new team, called **Early Adopters** with minimal settings, such as Public join options, and another team with multiple existing channels, called **Tech Meetings**.

	"description": "The Early Adopters Workspace.",

	"visibility": "Public" 

	}
	```

13. Select **Run** **query** from the upper right of the page.

#### Task 4 ‚Äì Archive and unarchive a team

After creating the different teams in this lab, you also need to evaluate the different ways of removing teams again. In this task you will test the archiving function and change the Sales team to a non-activate state without deleting its content. This function is required for some company‚Äôs compliance requirements of retaining the stored data inside the teams. The only Teams administrative role with sufficient privilege for this task is the Teams Administrator, which is currently assigned to Joni Sherman, therefore you will use Joni‚Äôs account for this task.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** with the credentials that have been provided to you.

2. Open Microsoft Edge, maximize the browser, and navigate to the **Teams admin center**: [https://admin.teams.microsoft.com](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).

13. Try to write a new conversation by selecting **New conversation** from the bottom.

14. You will see a message **This team was archived, so you can‚Äôt post more messages.** The archived status is also indicated by a small box icon, left from the three dots (‚Ä¶) menu, right from the team name.
